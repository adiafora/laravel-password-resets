Laravel. Reset a user's password using any field
=====================

Laravel offers an easy way to reset a user's password. But by default, the required field for the user that identifies the user when the password is reset is the email field. This package allows you to reset a user's password using any field from the User table. This can be a phone number, username, or any other unique field from the User table.

```
For Laravel < 5.5 Add in ServiceProvider to the providers array in `config/app.php`:
```php
    Adiafora\PasswordResets\PasswordResetsServiceProvider::class,
```

Publish the configuration:

```php
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Adiafora\PasswordResets\PasswordResetsServiceProvider"
```
